# hello-world

Hello there,

My name is Allyson Wagner, and I am a SMAD major, interactive design concentration, at JMU.

I also have two minors, general business, and British Media and communiciations. 

Pretzels may be my all time favorite food, because they come in so many shapes, sizes, and textures. They can also be paired with basically any kind of dip. Hummus? oh yeah. Queso? yes please. Tell me you know a more versatile food?
